# dlnd_project2_image_classification
Udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree Project 2

Like many of my coleagues on the training I could not run my project on Amazon AWS due to long response time on Amazon's part and I requested it a little too late as well.

On our slack forums we discussed running it on floydhub (THANK YOU FLOYBHUB!!!).

Also thank you for the creator of the repository https://github.com/ludwiktrammer/deep-learning/tree/master/image-classification

I coded using ludwikktrammer's repo and maintained the usage of Ciphar10 dataset by floydhub instead of downloading again to their servers.
